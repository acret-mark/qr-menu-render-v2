/**
 * Real Privacy Policy page (specs/027-privacy-policy-page, ai_workspace) —
 * replaces the placeholder shipped by 025-marketing-homepage task T009.
 *
 * Deliberately stays at this existing route rather than moving under the
 * `(marketing)` route group (no URL change, no unnecessary route-move
 * churn — plan.md Structure Decision); instead it imports the same
 * marketing chrome and fonts that group's layout.tsx uses, so a visitor
 * arriving from the homepage footer's "Privacy Policy" link sees one
 * continuous visual experience (spec FR-003, FR-004). This is the one
 * additional route Constitution Principle V's marketing-homepage exception
 * was extended to name (v1.2.0 → v1.3.0) — `/terms` is not covered by that
 * extension and stays untouched.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT apply the homepage's `mkt-reveal` scroll animation
 * (research.md #5) — a visitor following a deep anchor link needs the
 * target section immediately visible, not faded in.

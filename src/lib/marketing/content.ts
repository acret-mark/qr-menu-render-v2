 * Static marketing content for the homepage (`/`).

 * specs/025-marketing-homepage/ for the full field-by-field contract.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: the two Pro-tier bullets below intentionally do NOT match
 * design-reference/marketing/m-01-landing.html's own pricing card copy.
 * That mockup lists "AI-drafted item descriptions" and "Auto-translate:
 * English, Korean, Japanese & Mandarin" — neither is real SRS scope (§4.9
 * has no AI-description feature; §10 explicitly excludes "languages beyond
 * the two supported"). Corrected here per spec FR-003 — do not "fix" this
 * back to match the mockup's copy.

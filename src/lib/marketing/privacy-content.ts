/**
 * Static content for the real Privacy Policy page (`/privacy`), transcribed
 * from `docs/02_privacy-policy.md` (specs/027-privacy-policy-page, ai_workspace).
 *
 * This file deliberately does NOT transcribe two parts of that source document:
 * - The "⚠️ Drafting note (remove before publishing)" callout — addressed to
 *   the internal team, not public visitors (spec FR-007).
 * - The bracketed placeholders it flagged as unresolved (the Effective/Last
 *   Updated dates, and the "[Data Protection Officer / Privacy Contact Name]"
 *   line in §15) — replaced below by POLICY_META's resolved fallback values
 *   (spec FR-005, FR-006; resolved decision recorded in spec.md and
 *   research.md #3) rather than rendered as literal brackets.
 *
 * Editing the legal substance beyond those specific fallbacks is out of scope
 * for this file (spec FR-012) — any future correction is ACRET/legal
 * counsel's call, made by editing docs/02_privacy-policy.md first and this
 * transcription to match, not the other way around.
 *
 * Body-string conventions consumed by <PrivacyContent /> (privacy-content.tsx):
 * - Plain string → a paragraph.
 * - String starting with "- " → a bullet-list item (consecutive bullets group
 *   into one <ul>).
 * - String starting with "### " → a sub-heading within the section.
 * - String starting with "> " → a highlighted callout (used once, for the
 *   source document's own reader-facing "Quick Summary" — kept as-is since,
 *   unlike the drafting note, it contains no internal-only language).

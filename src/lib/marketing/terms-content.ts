/**
 * Static content for the real Terms & Conditions page (`/terms`), transcribed
 * from `docs/03_terms-and-conditions.md` (specs/028-terms-conditions-page, ai_workspace).
 *
 * This file deliberately does NOT transcribe three parts of that source document:
 * - The "⚠️ Drafting note (remove before publishing)" callout — addressed to
 *   the internal team, not public visitors (spec FR-007).
 * - The bracketed placeholders it flagged as unresolved (the Effective/Last
 *   Updated dates) — replaced below by TERMS_META's resolved fallback values
 *   (spec FR-005; resolved decision recorded in spec.md and research.md #3)
 *   rather than rendered as literal brackets.
 * - The inline "Jump to a section" quick-nav in §1 — superseded on the
 *   rendered page by <TermsToc />, which reads from TERMS_SECTIONS below
 *   (spec Edge Cases; research.md #4).
 *
 * The source document's two references to the Privacy Policy (§1, §18) point
 * at a stale relative path (`./10_privacy-policy.md`) that doesn't match this
 * repo's actual document. Both are transcribed using PRIVACY_POLICY_HREF
 * instead, so they resolve to the live `/privacy` route (spec FR-009;
 * research.md #5).
 *
 * Editing the legal substance beyond those specific fallbacks/link fixes is
 * out of scope for this file (spec FR-012) — any future correction (including
 * the refund policy and dispute-venue wording the source document itself
 * flags as pending ACRET/legal sign-off) is ACRET/legal counsel's call, made
 * by editing docs/03_terms-and-conditions.md first and this transcription to
 * match, not the other way around.
 *
 * Body-string conventions consumed by <TermsContent /> (terms-content.tsx),
 * matching the convention already established by privacy-content.ts:
 * - Plain string → a paragraph.
 * - String starting with "- " → a bullet-list item (consecutive bullets group
 *   into one <ul>), or a "1. " numbered item (consecutive numbered lines
 *   group into one <ol>).
 * - String starting with "### " → a sub-heading within the section.
 * - String starting with "> " → a highlighted callout (used once, for the
 *   source document's own reader-facing "Quick Summary" — kept as-is since,
 *   unlike the drafting note, it contains no internal-only language).
 * - The literal token "{{PRIVACY_LINK}}" → replaced with a working link to
 *   PRIVACY_POLICY_HREF (research.md #5).
